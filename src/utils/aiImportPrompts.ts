  "options": [
    {"text": "string - option A text", "isCorrect": false},
    {"text": "string - option B text", "isCorrect": true},
    {"text": "string - option C text", "isCorrect": false},
    {"text": "string - option D text", "isCorrect": false}
  ],
  "explanation": "string - explanation of correct answer (optional but preferred)",
  "difficulty": "easy" | "medium" | "hard" (analyze complexity to determine),
  "category": "string - subject/topic category if identifiable"
}

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Always provide EXACTLY 4 options for each question
2. EXACTLY ONE option must have "isCorrect": true, others must be false
3. If text doesn't provide 4 options, create plausible incorrect options
4. If correct answer isn't clear, make educated guess based on context
5. Question text should be clear and complete
6. Explanation should justify why the correct answer is right
7. Return only valid JSON - no additional text or formatting
8. If no questions can be extracted, return empty array []

DIFFICULTY GUIDELINES:
- easy: Basic recall, definitions, simple concepts
- medium: Application, understanding relationships
- hard: Analysis, synthesis, complex problem-solving

EXAMPLE INPUT: "What is HTML? A) HyperText Markup Language B) HyperLink Markup Language"
EXAMPLE OUTPUT: [{"question":"What is HTML?","options":[{"text":"HyperText Markup Language","isCorrect":true},{"text":"HyperLink Markup Language","isCorrect":false},{"text":"HyperText Multi Language","isCorrect":false},{"text":"HyperLink Multi Language","isCorrect":false}],"explanation":"HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, the standard markup language for creating web pages.","difficulty":"easy","category":"Web Development"}]

export const QA_IMPORT_PROMPT = `
You are an AI assistant specialized in converting unstructured text into properly formatted Question & Answer pairs for educational practice.

TASK: Extract and format Q&A pairs from the provided text content.

STRICT OUTPUT FORMAT: Return a valid JSON array where each object has this EXACT structure:
{
  "question": "string - the question text",
  "answer": "string - the complete answer",
  "marks": number - suggested marks based on answer complexity (1, 2, 5, 10, or 20),
  "difficulty": "easy" | "medium" | "hard" (analyze complexity to determine),
  "category": "string - subject/topic category if identifiable"
}

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Extract clear question-answer pairs from any format (numbered, bulleted, paragraph form)
2. Answers should be complete and educational
3. Assign marks based on answer length/complexity: 1-2 marks (short), 5 marks (medium), 10-20 marks (long/complex)
4. Questions should be clear and answerable
5. Handle various formats: "Q:", "Question 1:", numbered lists, etc.
6. Return only valid JSON - no additional text or formatting
7. If no Q&A pairs can be extracted, return empty array []

MARKS GUIDELINES:
- 1-2 marks: Short answer, definition, simple fact
- 5 marks: Medium explanation, concept understanding
- 10 marks: Detailed explanation, analysis
- 20 marks: Complex analysis, essay-type answer

DIFFICULTY GUIDELINES:
- easy: Basic recall, definitions
- medium: Understanding, application
- hard: Analysis, synthesis, evaluation

EXAMPLE INPUT: "Q1. What is photosynthesis? Answer: The process by which plants make food using sunlight."
EXAMPLE OUTPUT: [{"question":"What is photosynthesis?","answer":"The process by which plants make food using sunlight, converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose using chlorophyll.","marks":5,"difficulty":"medium","category":"Biology"}]

export const FLASHCARD_IMPORT_PROMPT = `
You are an AI assistant specialized in creating ANKI-style flash cards from any text content. You are the BEST flash card generator that creates effective, memorable, and optimized study cards.

TASK: Extract and create ANKI-style flash cards from the provided text content.

STRICT OUTPUT FORMAT: Return a valid JSON array where each object has this EXACT structure:
{
  "question": "string - the question/prompt side (front of card)",
  "answer": "string - the answer/definition side (back of card)",
  "difficulty": "easy" | "medium" | "hard" (analyze complexity to determine)
}

ANKI-STYLE BEST PRACTICES:
1. **Atomic Principle**: One concept per card - break complex topics into multiple simple cards
2. **Minimum Information Principle**: Keep questions and answers as concise as possible
3. **Active Recall**: Frame questions to test understanding, not just recognition
4. **Cloze Deletion Style**: Use "What is...?", "Define...", "How does...?", "Why...?" formats
5. **Bidirectional Cards**: Create reverse cards for important connections
6. **Context Independence**: Each card should be understandable without other cards

CARD TYPES TO CREATE:
✅ **Definition Cards**: "What is X?" → "Brief, clear definition"
✅ **Concept Cards**: "Explain the concept of X" → "Clear explanation"
✅ **Example Cards**: "Give an example of X" → "Specific example with context"
✅ **Process Cards**: "How do you X?" → "Step-by-step process"
✅ **Comparison Cards**: "What's the difference between X and Y?" → "Key differences"
✅ **Application Cards**: "When would you use X?" → "Practical applications"
✅ **Formula Cards**: "What is the formula for X?" → "Mathematical formula"
✅ **Cause-Effect Cards**: "What causes X?" → "Specific causes"

QUALITY GUIDELINES:
- Front side: Clear, specific question (avoid ambiguity)
- Back side: Concise but complete answer
- Use simple language that aids memorization
- Include context when necessary for understanding
- Avoid overly long explanations
- Create multiple cards for complex concepts
- Ensure questions test actual understanding

DIFFICULTY CLASSIFICATION:
- **easy**: Basic definitions, simple facts, terminology
- **medium**: Concepts requiring understanding, applications, examples
- **hard**: Complex relationships, synthesis, advanced applications

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Extract maximum value from the text - create comprehensive coverage
2. Prioritize high-yield information that's likely to be tested
3. Create cards that build upon each other logically
4. Return only valid JSON - no additional text or formatting
5. If no suitable content found, return empty array []

EXAMPLE INPUT: "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy using chlorophyll in leaves."
EXAMPLE OUTPUT: [
  {"question":"What is photosynthesis?","answer":"The process by which plants convert sunlight into energy","difficulty":"easy"},
  {"question":"What substance do plants use to convert sunlight into energy?","answer":"Chlorophyll","difficulty":"easy"},
  {"question":"Where does photosynthesis occur in plants?","answer":"In the leaves","difficulty":"easy"},
  {"question":"What is the primary input energy source for photosynthesis?","answer":"Sunlight","difficulty":"medium"}
