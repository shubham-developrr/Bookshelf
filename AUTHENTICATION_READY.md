## 🧪 **IMMEDIATE TESTING STEPS**

### **Step 1: Test User Registration**
1. **Click** the blue "🔐 Login / Register" button (top-left corner)
2. **Switch to** "Create Account" mode
3. **Fill in** the registration form:
   - Email: `test@example.com`
   - Password: `test123` (minimum 6 characters)
   - Username: `testuser`
   - Full Name: `Test User`
4. **Click** "Create Account"
5. **Verify** the status checker shows "authenticated" instead of "anonymous"

### **Step 2: Test Login/Logout**
1. **After registration**, you should see a user profile card (top-left)
2. **Click "Logout"** to test logout functionality
3. **Click "🔐 Login / Register"** again
4. **Login** with the same credentials
5. **Verify** you're logged back in

### **Step 3: Test Data Persistence**
1. **While logged in**, navigate through some content
2. **Create highlights** by selecting text
3. **Check progress tracking** by reading chapters
4. **Open a new browser tab** with the same URL
5. **Verify** your data appears instantly (real-time sync)

## 🎯 **EXPECTED RESULTS**

### **After Registration**
- ✅ Status checker shows "User: authenticated"
- ✅ User profile card appears (top-left)
- ✅ No authentication errors in console

### **Real-time Sync Test**
- ✅ Changes in one tab appear immediately in other tabs
- ✅ Progress saves automatically as you navigate
- ✅ Highlights sync across devices instantly

### **Database Verification**
- ✅ User profile created in `profiles` table
- ✅ Progress tracked in `user_progress` table
- ✅ Highlights saved in `user_highlights` table

## 🚨 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **If Registration Fails**
1. **Check browser console** for error messages
2. **Verify** Supabase status shows "connected"
3. **Try** a different email address
4. **Ensure** password is at least 6 characters

### **If Status Shows Red**
1. **Refresh** the page
2. **Check** internet connection
3. **Verify** `.env.local` has correct Supabase credentials

### **If Real-time Doesn't Work**
1. **Check** both tabs are logged in as the same user
2. **Wait** a few seconds for subscription to establish
3. **Look** for WebSocket connections in Network tab
